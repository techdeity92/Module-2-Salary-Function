# Employee Data Processing and Export

This project provides a comprehensive solution for processing employee salary data in both Python and R.

## Features

* Read employee data from a CSV file.
* Extract specific employee details by name.
* Export employee data to a CSV file and zip it.
* Unzip and display data using R for analysis.
* Error handling for missing files, incorrect data, and processing issues.

## Python Implementation

* Uses Pandas for data manipulation and processing.
* Handles mixed data types and duplicate records.
* Dynamic file path input for compatibility across different systems.

## R Implementation

* Uses dplyr for data filtering and manipulation.
* Reads CSV data, processes employee information, and zips the output.
* Extracts and displays data for further analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the CSV file in the working directory or provide the full file path.
3. Run the Python script or the R script as per the requirements.

## Requirements

* The program follows the assignment structure, ensuring that all functions are clearly defined and logically organized.
* All error handling is implemented to handle missing files, incorrect data formats, and duplicate records.
* The main functions in both Python and R provide a smooth user experience, prompting for necessary inputs and displaying relevant information.
